The Corporation decided to build a Cricket stadium in the area for school and college students, but the area was used as a car parking zone. In order to protect the land from being used as an unauthorised parking zone, the corporation wanted to protect the stadium by building a fence. In order to help the workers to build a fence, they planned to place a thick rope around the ground. They wanted to buy only the exact length of the rope that is needed. They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a carpet during the rainy season. They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. They requested your help. Can you please help them by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity of carpet that is required? Input format: Input consists of 2 integers. The first integer corresponds to the length of the ground and the second integer corresponds to the breadth of the ground. Output Format: Output Consists of two integers.
